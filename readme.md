# What it does?

Finds the best combination of sellers and postage options for a selection of Amazon products

# How it works?

You browse Amazon products and select the ones you are interested in
It then scans Amazon and other dealer prices (used or not)
And chooses the best combination of dealers so the final cost is minimal
It also takes postage into account
You can also tweak the price selection (e.g. discard a dealer, skip used items, etc.)
And finally, it places all of the items in your cart
After that, you can purchase them from Amazon, as usual

# What does Dealesque get out of it?

Dealesque is Amazon affiliate, so we get a small commision out of the items you actually end up buying
No expense on your side, whatsoever

# Can we make it better?

Sure :-) For example, it would be nice if Amazon opened up their Wish List API again
That way you could prepare a list on Amazon, and let Dealesque use items in that list directly
Unfortunately, that can't be done at this time, but maybe we'll find a way around this
Stay tuned!
