# TODO Evolution of design

Take a use case, like SearchAmazon and how it evolved:
* first was the use case with stubbed amazon client
* then amazon client with stubbed parser
* then parser with manually recorded response
* then integration test with vcr recorded response
* the amazon client has some pain points
  * hard coded reference to AmazonSearchResponseParser
  * testing due to above issue
  tried injecting dependency to AmazonSearchResponseParser in client but it didn't feel right
  decided to go with the current version
* and finally controller that uses all of it
* in a dream, "inverse dependencies" hit me
  so I yanked AmazonSearchResponseParser out of client and injected it into SearchAmazon use case
* tests became simpler
* and the ceremony / verbosity moved to use case and it's usage, but that was OK

This actually enabled plans to implement parser selection as in Avdi's book instead of directly injecting it.
Show all the steps and why and how they happened, from use case that defined all other players etc.
A solid test bed enabled refactoring with a safety net.
See next topic for reference!

  * Ruby Rogues Parley topic
  * Hexagonal - I guess it's OK when injecting from outside in (SearchResponse parser)

Take all Dealesque and other links and organize them in a page
Maybe as a gist or even a github repo so it can be forked and updated

# TODO Structure of app, new folders (services, values, ... even lib) and how to autoload them in Rails and specs

Sandi Metzâ€™ rules for developers
	1.	Your class can be no longer than a hundred lines of code.
	2.	Your methods can be no longer than five lines of code
	3.	You can pass no more than four parameters and you can't just make it one big hash.
	4.	In your controller, you can only instantiate one object, to do whatever it is that needs to be done.
	5.	Your view can only know about one instance variable.
  6.  Your Rails view should only send messages to that object i.e., no Demeter violations.[  "thunder dome principal". Translated: one model in, one model out! ]
  7.  Rules are meant to be broken if by breaking them you produce better code. [ ...where "better code" is validated by explaining why you want to break the rule to someone else. ]

Sandi Metz' three (sic) rules of testing
	1.	Make assertions about state for incoming messages.
	2.	Make assertions that you send outgoing messages. [Only do #2 for outgoing /command/ messages.  Don't bother testing query methods at all, though you may need to stub those to make your tests work right.]
	3.	Ignore private methods.
  4.  Test roles.  Make tests prove they are playing the correct role (and not just testing the mock / double)

The idea is to follow the rules, see where it leads
